<h1>Spellstrike!</h1>
<p>Spellstrike is a features-light fighting game mostly focused on striking.</p>
<p>It may also have a few spells here and there - my questionable artistic skills leave plenty up to the imagination.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wield both sword and sorcery (some imagination required) to overcome your opponent in fast-paced battles</li>
    <li>Choose 1 of 4 characters, each with a slightly-different silhouette and more-different playstyle</li>
    <li>Play with controller, keyboard, or some unsightly combination of the two</li>
    <li>(Desktop Only) If you're willing to put up with port forwarding, play online with friends far away with rollback netcode!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Extended Description for Rambling</h1>
<h2>Summary for Fighting Game Players</h3>
<p>For folks familiar with fighting games, here's a more detailed rundown:</p>
<p>
    This is a 4-button game (Light, Medium, Heavy, and Special). 
    Every character has, at a minimum, one attack for each Normal button and 2 Special attacks: 
    one when used in neutral (usually defensive), and another when used to cancel after a 
    successful attack (usually offensive). 
</p>
<p> 
    Characters have unique rules for canceling and chaining 
    attacks, with a few common principles:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Normals can only be canceled into other moves after a successful hit.</li>
    <li>Heavy normals cannot be canceled.</li>
    <li>Special moves cannot be canceled, though some recover very quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Specials are limited use: players get 5 "charges" at the start of each round. Specials in neutral 
    cost 1 charge, special cancels cost 2 charges. There's no way to replenish charges (in this 
    version of the game, anyway) - once they're gone, characters lose an important defensive tool.
</p>
<p>
    Also very important to note: there's no blocking or jumping. Should be fine, though. Just don't get hit.
</p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>
    Spellstrike was built in the style of traditional 2D fighting games, but with drastically 
    (perhaps commically) large cuts to "standard" features. There's no jumping, no throwing, 
    no crouching, and - most importantly - no blocking. There were two main motiviations: I figured
    it'd be an interesting design challenge, and I figured that every feature I could cut would
    reduce the odds I'd accidentally introduce some terrible mistakes while working on a tight
    schedule.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, I think the project worked out okay. The characters definitely have different strengths
    and weaknesses, but I think it'd take more playing to really dig into how different their play
    patterns are. 
</p>
<p>
    One of the biggest challenges I faced was related to no blocking & no knockdowns. I think that
    those states of temporary disadvantage are where a lot of gameplay nuance is concentrated. It's
    also important how those states give players a different mode of thinking to switch to, a 
    different style of mental puzzle to play with. That variety is important for making the gameplay
    feel more substantial (and make grinding out long sets easier) and that's something I think this
    version of the game will have trouble with. We'll see how it shakes out in practice.
</p>
<p>
    There were several interesting technical results of this work. I'm not going to write it up
    now, but I probably should do a postmortem on how things went for my future reference.
